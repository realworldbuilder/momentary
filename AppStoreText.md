Workout Notebook for Your Wrist

## Description
Start a workout on your Apple Watch. Log moments by voice. Turn training into insights and content.

Momentary is a wrist-first workout notebook built for lifters who want to capture every set, every PR, and every training thought — without stopping to type. Record short voice "Moments" during your strength training session, and when you're done, AI transforms your voice notes into structured workout logs, social media content, and personalized training insights.

KEY FEATURES

• Workout Sessions — Start and end strength training sessions right from your Apple Watch with an elapsed timer and moment counter.

• Voice Moments — Tap to record a quick voice note after each set. "Just hit 225 for 5 on bench, felt smooth." That's all you need.

• On-Device Transcription — Speech-to-text powered by WhisperKit runs entirely on your iPhone. No internet required to record and transcribe.

• AI Workout Log — When your workout ends, OpenAI analyzes your voice transcripts and generates a structured exercise log with exercises, sets, reps, and weights.

• Social Content — Auto-generate Instagram captions, tweet threads, reel scripts, and story cards from your workout. Share your training without the effort.

• Training Insights — Get AI-generated progress notes, form reminders, motivational stories, and recovery suggestions based on your actual training.

• HealthKit Integration — Your workouts automatically sync to Apple Health as strength training sessions.

• Watch-First Experience — Full workout lifecycle on Apple Watch with haptic feedback when moments are logged. Always-on display shows your workout timer.

• Offline Support — Record and transcribe without internet. AI processing queues up and completes when you're back online.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Start a workout on your Apple Watch (or iPhone)
2. After each set, tap to record a quick voice moment
3. Your voice is transcribed on-device by WhisperKit
4. End your workout — AI processes your moments into a structured log
5. Review your workout log, share content, and read insights

PRIVACY

Audio is transcribed on-device — your voice never leaves your phone. Only workout transcript text is sent to OpenAI for AI processing (requires your own API key). No accounts, no analytics, no tracking.

Requires iPhone running iOS 18+ and Apple Watch running watchOS 11+.

## Notes for Review
Momentary requires an Apple Watch paired with an iPhone to demonstrate the full watch workout workflow. However, the app also supports starting workouts and recording moments directly on iPhone — you can test this without an Apple Watch.

On first launch, the app loads a local speech recognition model (WhisperKit). This may take a few seconds. Once loaded, recording and transcription work entirely offline.

AI features (structured workout log, social content, training insights) require an OpenAI API key entered in Settings. Without a key, the app still functions as a voice-based workout logger — you just won't get AI-generated output.

No account, login, or special configuration is needed beyond the optional API key.
