## FAQ

### Does WristAssist upload my audio or transcriptions?
No. WristAssist processes audio on-device and does not upload your recordings or transcriptions to a server.

### Why am I not seeing a transcription?
- Make sure your Apple Watch is paired with your iPhone.
- Keep your iPhone nearby and open the iPhone app at least once.
- Confirm Bluetooth/Wi‑Fi are enabled.
- Record a longer sample with clear speech.

### I see “No response from iPhone”
- Open the iPhone app once (foreground).
- Keep the iPhone within Bluetooth range.
- Try again with Wi‑Fi enabled on both devices.
