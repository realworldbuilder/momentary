# Momentary — Roadmap

## What Is Momentary?

Forked from [WristAssist](https://github.com/realworldbuilder/wristassist) (a simple voice notes app). Transformed into a **wrist-first workout notebook** where you start a strength training session on Apple Watch, record short voice "Moments" during the workout, and get AI-generated structured logs, social content, and training insights when the workout ends.

- **iOS 18 / watchOS 11** minimum (uses `@Observable`)
- **WhisperKit** for on-device transcription (bundled Whisper tiny model)
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** for AI processing (bundled API key via XOR obfuscation)

| Entitlements + Info.plist keys | DONE | pbxproj build settings |
| Wired into both orchestrators | DONE | `WorkoutManager.swift`, `WatchWorkoutManager.swift` |

### Phase 4: AI Processing — COMPLETE
OpenAI GPT-4o generates structured workout logs, social content, and insights.

| Step | Status | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| AI backend protocol + OpenAI implementation | DONE | `Momentary/AIProcessingService.swift` |
| Prompt construction | DONE | `Momentary/AIPromptBuilder.swift` |
| Processing pipeline (offline queue, retry) | DONE | `Momentary/AIProcessingPipeline.swift` |
| Bundled API key (XOR obfuscation) | DONE | `Momentary/APIKeyProvider.swift` |

### Phase 5: Polish & Deliverables — COMPLETE

| Step | Status | Files |
|------|--------|-------|

| README | DONE | `README.md` |
| App Store text | DONE | `AppStoreText.md` |

## What's Next: Testing & Bug Fixing

The full codebase has been written but has **not yet been compiled or tested**. The next session should focus on:

### Priority 1: Get It Compiling
- Open in Xcode, build both targets (iOS + watchOS)
- Fix any compile errors (likely cross-file resolution issues, missing imports, type mismatches)
- Resolve any Swift concurrency / Sendable warnings

### Priority 2: Core Workout Flow (Watch)
- Start workout on watch
- Record 3+ voice moments
- Verify audio files are created per-moment
- Verify audio transfers to iPhone via WCSession
- Verify WhisperKit transcribes audio on phone
- Verify transcription text sent back to watch
- End workout, verify summary screen

### Priority 3: Core Workout Flow (iPhone)
- Start workout on iPhone directly
- Record moments using phone mic
- End workout, verify session persists to disk
- Verify workout appears in history list
- Tap into workout detail view

### Priority 4: AI Processing
- End a workout with moments
- Verify OpenAI API call fires with bundled key
- Verify structured log, content pack, and insights parse correctly
- Verify they render in WorkoutDetailView
- Test offline queue (airplane mode -> end workout -> restore network)

### Priority 5: HealthKit
- Verify workout appears in Apple Health after ending
- Verify HealthKit authorization prompt

### Priority 6: Cross-Device Sync
- Start on watch, verify phone shows active state
- Record moments from both devices
- End from either side

### Priority 7: Edge Cases
- Kill app mid-workout, relaunch, verify state
- Empty workout (no moments), end gracefully
- Very long moments (60s+ recording)
- Network errors during AI processing (verify retry/queue)

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **`@Observable`** (not `@StateObject`) for all managers — injected via `.environment()`
- **Directory-per-workout** storage: `Documents/workouts/<UUID>/session.json`
- **Callback closures** on connectivity managers (not owning business logic)
- **Offline AI queue** at `Documents/pending_ai_queue.json`
- **XOR-obfuscated bundled API key** — Keychain override available in Settings
- **Bundle IDs**: `com.momentary.app` (iOS), `com.momentary.app.watchkitapp` (watchOS)
- **Dev team**: `R2C4T4N7US`
